# RS-Net
The Remote Sensing Network (RS-Net) is a cloud detection algorithm for satellite imagery. The code in this repository was used to to produce all results for the paper titled "A cloud detection algorithm for satellite imagery based on deep learning". A production level implementation is currently under development, which will form the basis for future research in deep learning for remote sensing purposes. This includes research on semi-supervised learning, multi-temporal classification, and interpretability/explainability. 

Note: The requirements.txt file currently contain all packages installed in the environment used for running the experiments, but most of these packages are not necessary to run the code for RS-Net.
