    "TOA stands for top-of-atmosphere reflectance, which is a measure of how much solar radiation is reflected by the Earth's surfaceÂ¹. To generate a TOA file with GDAL from a Landsat image, you need to convert the digital numbers (DN) of the image bands to TOA reflectance values using a formula that depends on the sensor type, band number, and acquisition dateÂ². You can use the `gdal_translate` tool to apply the formula and create a new raster file with TOA reflectance values for each band. Alternatively, you can use QGIS to calculate TOA reflectance with a solar angle correction for specific bandsÂ³.\n",
